Unofficial port of **Thaumcraft 4.2.3.5** to **Minecraft 1.21.1**, built on NeoForge and Java 21.

> **Personal use only.** Thaumcraft and all of its assets belong to Azanor. This repository contains the original mod's logic and assets and is not intended for redistribution.

The project was inspired by [Thaumcraft 3: Reforged](https://github.com/notlikethiss/thaumcraft-3-reforged).

## Overview

The port includes research, aspects, aura nodes, wands and staves, alchemy, infusion, essentia networks, golems, equipment and the Outer Lands. A separate public API and addon SDK provide extension points for additional content.

Version **1.0.0** is available for testing. Automated verification covers API rules and selected gameplay scenarios. Manual visual and multiplayer acceptance remains in progress. Hidden Magic Box storage is not implemented.

## Requirements

| Component | Supported version | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minecraft | 1.21.1 | Required |
| Java | 21 | Required |
| NeoForge | 21.1.252 ≤ version < 21.2 | Required |
| Curios | 9.5.1+1.21.1 ≤ version < 10 | Required |
| AOP: UI | Compatible 0.7.x build | Required on client and server |
| TerraBlender | 4.1.0.8 ≤ version < 4.2 | Optional |

Dependencies must target Minecraft 1.21.1 and NeoForge. Without TerraBlender, the built-in biome placement fallback is used.

## Installation

1. Install Minecraft, Java, NeoForge and the required dependencies.
2. Place `thaumcraft-1.21.1-1.0.0.jar` in the instance's `mods` directory on both client and server.
3. Install a compatible AOP: UI gameplay JAR on both sides.

The gameplay JAR includes the public API. Separate API and sources JARs are development artifacts and must not be installed as mods. Existing worlds should be backed up before testing an update.

### Related projects

- **Thaumic Tinkerer** provides additional devices, foci and KAMI content. It requires a compatible core build.
- **AOP:TC4 Compact** provides optional JEI/EMI recipe integration and Jade/WTHIT tooltips. These integrations are separate from the core.
- **AOP: UI** provides the shared configuration interface.

## Configuration and controls

The Thaumonomicon introduces research and progression. The Thaumometer discovers aspects through scanning.

| Default key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| F | Select a focus |
| H | Toggle the harness |
| G | Change architect mode |
| Shift+G | Change architect axis |

Key bindings can be reassigned in Minecraft settings.

Client configuration is stored in `config/thaumcraft-client.toml`; server configuration is stored with the world. The shared settings interface opens from Mods, the Thaumonomicon gear or the AOP: UI button in the pause menu.

Client changes are saved immediately. Server changes are committed with **Save** or **Esc**. Multiplayer editing requires OP level 4; the singleplayer world owner can edit without enabling cheats. Options marked for restart retain their current effective value until restart. Existing configuration keys and defaults are preserved.

## Building from source

Build AOP: UI first and provide its gameplay JAR as a Gradle dependency. With JDK 21 available, run from this repository:

```powershell
./gradlew.ps1 build -PaopUiJar=C:/dependencies/aopui-1.21.1-0.7.0.jar
```

On Linux and macOS, use `sh ./gradlew` with the same task and properties. Dependencies are downloaded during the initial build. Minecraft and NeoForge versions are defined in `gradle.properties`.

| Output | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mod/build/libs/thaumcraft-1.21.1-1.0.0.jar` | Gameplay mod |
| `api/build/libs/thaumcraft-api-1.0.0.jar` | Addon development dependency |
| `mod/build/libs/thaumcraft-1.21.1-1.0.0-sources.jar` | Source archive |

The development client uses `:mod:runClient`; the addon SDK uses `addonSdk`. Both commands accept the same `aopUiJar` property. The [addon development guide](docs/addons/README.en.md) documents SDK installation, data formats and public API contracts.

## Verification and continuous integration

`build` compiles the project and executes the API and standalone rule checks. Gameplay verification uses separate source sets excluded from the gameplay JAR. Build success and in-game verification are separate results.

Source and build changes trigger CI; documentation-only changes do not. Pushes to `main` retain the separate nightly channel.

In **Actions → Build and release → Run workflow**, enable **release** to publish an ordinary GitHub release with tag `v<version>`. Leave **version** blank to use `mod_version` from `gradle.properties`, or enter `major.minor.patch` to override it for that run. The selected version is used in the JAR metadata, filenames and tag; the workflow does not modify the source files. Prerelease suffixes are rejected in release mode. Existing release tags are never overwritten. With **release** disabled, a manual run builds artifacts without publishing. Local `act` runs never publish. Ordinary release notes list every commit since the nearest previous ordinary release on the selected history, with commit links and a comparison link. The first release includes the full history. Nightly notes omit this list.

For local `act` runs, place compatible dependency source checkouts at `.dependencies/aopui` before running `act workflow_dispatch --input release=true`. Local runs use these checkouts and skip GitHub publication. For private dependency repositories, configure the optional `DEPENDENCY_TOKEN` secret with read access to those repositories.

| Repository variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AOPUI_REPOSITORY` | AOP: UI source; `Salossov/aop-ui` |
| `AOPUI_REF` | AOP: UI source revision; defaults to `main` |

Bug reports should include component versions, reproduction steps, expected and actual behavior, and the relevant log or crash report. Credentials and personal information should be removed from attachments.
